### Feature Request

1. Fork the main branch to your github account
2. Create a new branch
3. Add validation to the `Widget` class so that the name must be present and unique, and the purpose must be present if the widget is active.
4. Add error messages to the form so that if the record fails validation, the user is shown what to fix, and user values that the user entered are not lost.
5. Create a pull request against your forked main (in your repo, not beezwax's).
